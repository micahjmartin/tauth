# Tauth 1.4
- Added support for users prefered shell
- Implemented support for secure ssms with the "AllowSMS email" option WARNING: NO ERROR CHECKING

- Updated readme. command changed from 'TAUTH' to 'tauth'
- Added Changelog!!
- Disabled logging, Ill get around to fixing that later
- Changed name of 'conf' to 'tauth_config'. That is the name it will be when on a server.
